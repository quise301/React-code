      "Our problems all began on March 23, 2018, when our 10 year Paint Gelding Major became ill suddenly. In the next 2 weeks we had a very ill horse with high fevers and a bacterial infection that was affecting his left hind leg. 10 days into it, the leg burst open in 4 places, 2 of which were on the lower leg.",

    story:
      "Now a four-year-old, Barney Rumbles is lucky to be alive, let alone racing again, after surviving a suspected spider bite last year. He’s had a chequered twelve months, Observed Mick Price, who trains the horse in partnership with Michael Kent (Jnr). He was out of business, he was nearly underground there for a little while, had a very infected leg, had a lot of anti-inflammatories, antibiotics. He was a wasted, sick horse. It was Price’s partner, Shona Drechsler, who played a crucial role in Barney Rumbles’s recovery. I remember Shona was at him every single day with yogurt and all this stuff for his gut, he said. ",

      "From the first moment he walked into my horse trailer without a fuss, I knew he was special. I did not know how special, until I started to work with him. I usually let a wild mustang get accustomed to their new surroundings for a few days before I start training. However, as soon as he looked around his corral he cautiously came up for a touch on his nose.",

    story:
      "My neighbor, Gail, called and her older horse is having a bout of colic, the other neighbor, Lydia told her about MiVet. She got the app and immediately set up an account. An equine veterinarian came over with a stethoscope to help check for gut sounds. When I got there they had just given her a minor herbal treatment, and at that time there was no gut sound. They stayed for about 1 1/2 hours and the gut sound was coming back and the mare seemed to be feeling okay. I went back the next morning, and her mare was okay.",

    story:
      "When I was fourteen, my Mother let me adopt a wild Mustang from the Bureau of Land Management. We drove three and a half hours inland to the holding corrals in Susanville, California. Each corral held dozens of nervous Mustangs milling about like a school of fish avoiding prey. Immediately I spotted a beautiful black stallion in the bunch. 20 months old and very underweight, I could hide my fingers between her ribs under that dried out matted coat. Skinny chest, narrow hips and legs that seemed too long she was like a big awkward puppy. By the time she was three I was riding her all over the neighborhood and into town. Mostly bareback, sometimes with a saddle. She continued to grow. She had a case of the long tall skinnys, like you see with teenage boys in High School. ",

      "Horace is a tall anthropomorphic black horse and is one of Mickey Mouse's best friends. Characterized as a boastful show-off, Horace served as Mickey’s sidekick in Disney’s early black-and-white shorts. A common gag in his early appearances was his ability to change at will from being a normal horse to a more human-like character. In the television series Disney's House of Mouse, Horace has a recurring role as the club's technician, playing cartoons for the audiences and generally running the machinery.",
